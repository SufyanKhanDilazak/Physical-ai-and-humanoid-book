## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully implemented comprehensive book content for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book across all four modules:

Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Created 3 detailed chapters covering ROS 2 fundamentals, Python agents with rclpy, and URDF for humanoid robots

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Created 2 chapters covering physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity digital twins in Unity

Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Created 2 chapters covering NVIDIA Isaac Sim for perception and navigation with Isaac ROS + Nav2

Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Created 2 chapters covering voice-to-action pipelines and the capstone autonomous humanoid project

Updated sidebar configuration to include all new content. All content follows academic standards with proper citations, code examples, and learning outcomes as specified in the project constitution.
