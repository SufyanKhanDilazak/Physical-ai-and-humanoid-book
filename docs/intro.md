# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed for CS students at Grade 10-12 level who want to learn about robotics, AI, and humanoid control.

## What You'll Learn

This book is organized into four main modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn about ROS 2 middleware, Python agents with rclpy, and URDF for humanoid robots
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity digital twins in Unity
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim for perception and navigation with Isaac ROS + Nav2
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Master voice-to-action pipelines and work on a capstone autonomous humanoid project

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Robotics students and engineers
- Computer science students at Grade 10-12 level
- Anyone interested in learning about humanoid robot control and AI

## How to Use This Book

Each module contains:
- Theoretical concepts and explanations
- Practical code examples
- Hands-on exercises
- Real-world applications

All code examples are designed to be reproducible and include proper citations following APA format.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Python (for ROS 2 sections)
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

Let's begin with Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2).
