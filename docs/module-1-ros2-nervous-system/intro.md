# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This module will introduce you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will learn about:

- **ROS 2 fundamentals**: Understanding nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **DDS and QoS**: How ROS 2 uses Data Distribution Service for communication
- **Python integration**: Using rclpy to create Python-based robot controllers
- **URDF modeling**: Creating Unified Robot Description Format models for humanoid robots

## Why ROS 2 Matters

ROS 2 provides the middleware infrastructure that allows different components of a robot to communicate and coordinate effectively. Just as the nervous system in biological organisms transmits signals between the brain and various parts of the body, ROS 2 enables communication between different software components of a robot.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. [ROS 2 as the Robotic Nervous System](./ros2-as-nervous-system) - Core concepts and architecture
2. [Python Agents with rclpy](./python-agents-rclpy) - Python-based robot control
3. [URDF for Humanoid Robots](./urdf-humanoid-robots) - Robot description and modeling

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Python (for ROS 2 sections)
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

Let's begin with understanding the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 middleware!
