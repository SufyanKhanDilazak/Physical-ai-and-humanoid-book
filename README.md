# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

A comprehensive educational resource for learning robotics, AI, and humanoid control with ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Overview

This book provides a complete curriculum for CS students at Grade 10-12 level who want to learn about robotics, AI, and humanoid control. The content is organized into four main modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn about ROS 2 middleware, Python agents with rclpy, and URDF for humanoid robots
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity digital twins in Unity
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim for perception and navigation with Isaac ROS + Nav2
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Master voice-to-action pipelines and work on a capstone autonomous humanoid project

## Features

- Comprehensive educational content with theoretical concepts and practical applications
- Step-by-step tutorials with reproducible examples
- Academic-level writing appropriate for Grade 10-12 students
- Integration with leading robotics frameworks and tools
- Proper citations following APA format
